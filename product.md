We want to build our ecommerce website to sell our product.
Our model is a B2B and B2C company so we want to sell to big companies and also simple customers.
Be simple: in our platform, only one item can be bought at the time.

The product must accept 3 inputs from the user:
- How many items
- Price per item
- 2-letter state code

The program have to output the total price.
Give a discount base on the total price, add state tax based on the state and the discounted price.

Here is the table of discount rate:

| Order value   | Discount Rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $1,000        | 3%            |
| $5,000        | 5%            |

| $10,000       | 10%           |
