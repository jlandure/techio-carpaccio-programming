# Welcome to the Elephant Carpaccio programming!
_Based on Elephant Carpaccio exercise from Alistair Cockburn_

# Instructions

1. Break into teams of 2-3 people, one workstation par team.
2. Preparation: Each team writes down _on paper_ the 10-20 demo-able user stories they will develop and possibly demo. Each should be doable in 3 minutes. No slide is just mockup of UI, creation of data table or data structure. All demos show real input & output (not test harness).
3. Discussion: Instructor/facilitator leads discussion of the slides, what is and isn't acceptable, solicits ways to slide finer.
4. Development: A fixe time-box of 40 minutes, seven 3-minute development sprints, clock does not stop. At the end of each sprint, each team shows its product and announce its ranking (the step where the team is)
5. Debrief
