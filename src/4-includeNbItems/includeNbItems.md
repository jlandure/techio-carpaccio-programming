# Step 4

Now, we want to display the price if the customer take more than one item.
We also want to display the price all taxes included for the state "CA"
If the state is not "CA", please display the price without tax.

@[Are you able to display the price?]({"stubs": ["/4-includeNbItems/includeNbItems.js"], "command": "npm test 4"})

With this step, we have a new version to allow our customer to buy more than one item! Great!
