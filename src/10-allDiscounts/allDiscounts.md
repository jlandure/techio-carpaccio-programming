# Step 10 - Final Step

To finish, let's implement all the discounts in our ecommerce website.

@[Are you able to display the price?]({"stubs": ["/10-allDiscounts/allDiscounts.js"], "command": "npm test 10"})

With this step, we have a fully ecommerce website available in 5 states and offering different kind of discount.

**Congratulations**

### Why Elephant Carpaccio?

It's very thin slices, each one still elephant-shaped. Together they form the whole elephant.

### Why split stories?
Learn faster. Deliver more often. Happier stakeholders. More in-sync with other people & teams. Better prioritizations. Better product earlier. More business options. Less risk (less time “underwater”). Sense of velocity. Easier planning.
